        # This is important if your GitHub Pages is served from a subdirectory
        # For example, if your repo is `username/repo-name` and you want to serve from `repo-name`
        # then you might need to set a base URL in your vite.config.ts and here.
        # For now, assuming it's served from the root of the gh-pages branch.
